.SH "NAME"
perf-script-python \- Process trace data with a Python script
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIperf script\fR [\-s [Python]:script[\&.py] ]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This perf script option is used to process perf script data using perf\(cqs built\-in Python interpreter\&. It reads and processes the input file and displays the results of the trace analysis implemented in the given Python script, if any\&.
.SH "A QUICK EXAMPLE"
.sp
This section shows the process, start to finish, of creating a working Python script that aggregates and extracts useful information from a raw perf script stream\&. You can avoid reading the rest of this document if an example is enough for you; the rest of the document provides more details on each step and lists the library functions available to script writers\&.
.sp
This example actually details the steps that were used to create the \fIsyscall\-counts\fR script you see when you list the available perf script scripts via \fIperf script \-l\fR\&. As such, this script also shows how to integrate your script into the list of general\-purpose \fIperf script\fR scripts listed by that command\&.
.sp
The syscall\-counts script is a simple script, but demonstrates all the basic ideas necessary to create a useful script\&. Here\(cqs an example of its output (syscall names are not yet supported, they will appear as numbers):

Basically our task is to keep a per\-syscall tally that gets updated every time a system call occurs in the system\&. Our script will do that, but first we need to record the data that will be processed by that script\&. Theoretically, there are a couple of ways we could do that:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
we could enable every event under the tracing/events/syscalls directory, but this is over 600 syscalls, well beyond the number allowable by perf\&. These individual syscall events will however be useful if we want to later use the guidance we get from the general\-purpose scripts to drill down and get more detail about individual syscalls of interest\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
we can enable the sys_enter and/or sys_exit syscalls found under tracing/events/raw_syscalls\&. These are called for all syscalls; the
\fIid\fR
field can be used to distinguish between individual syscall numbers\&.
.RE
.sp
For this script, we only need to know that a syscall was entered; we don\(cqt care how it exited, so we\(cqll use \fIperf record\fR to record only the sys_enter events:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
# perf record \-a \-e raw_syscalls:sys_enter

^C[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 56\&.545 MB perf\&.data (~2470503 samples) ]
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The options basically say to collect data for every syscall event system\-wide and multiplex the per\-cpu output into a single stream\&. That single stream will be recorded in a file in the current directory called perf\&.data\&.
.sp
Once we have a perf\&.data file containing our data, we can use the \-g \fIperf script\fR option to generate a Python script that will contain a callback handler for each event type found in the perf\&.data trace stream (for more details, see the STARTER SCRIPTS section)\&.

.if n \{\
.RS 4

At the top is a comment block followed by some import statements and a path append which every perf script script should include\&.
.sp
Following that are a couple generated functions, trace_begin() and trace_end(), which are called at the beginning and the end of the script respectively (for more details, see the SCRIPT_LAYOUT section below)\&.
.sp
Following those are the \fIevent handler\fR functions generated one for every event in the \fIperf record\fR output\&. The handler functions take the form subsystem\fIevent_name, and contain named parameters, one for each field in the event; in this case, there\(cqs only one event, raw_syscalls\fRsys_enter()\&. (see the EVENT HANDLERS section below for more info on event handlers)\&.
.sp
The final couple of functions are, like the begin and end functions, generated for every script\&. The first, trace_unhandled(), is called every time the script finds an event in the perf\&.data file that doesn\(cqt correspond to any event handler in the script\&. This could mean either that the record step recorded event types that it wasn\(cqt really interested in, or the script was run against a trace file that doesn\(cqt correspond to the script\&.
.sp
The script generated by \-g option simply prints a line for each event found in the trace stream i\&.e\&. it basically just dumps the event and its parameter values to stdout\&. The print_header() function is simply a utility function used for that purpose\&. Let\(cqs rename the script and run it to see the default output:

Of course, for this script, we\(cqre not interested in printing every trace event, but rather aggregating it in a useful way\&. So we\(cqll get rid of everything to do with printing as well as the trace_begin() and trace_unhandled() functions, which we won\(cqt be using\&. That leaves us with this minimalistic skeleton:

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In trace_end(), we\(cqll simply print the results, but first we need to generate some results to print\&. To do that we need to have our sys_enter() handler do the necessary tallying until all events have been counted\&. A hash table indexed by syscall id is a good way to store that information; every time the sys_enter() handler is called, we simply increment a count associated with that hash entry indexed by that syscall id:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
  syscalls = autodict()

  try:
    syscalls[id] += 1
  except TypeError:
    syscalls[id] = 1

.if n \{\

.sp
The syscalls \fIautodict\fR object is a special kind of Python dictionary (implemented in Core\&.py) that implements Perl\(cqs \fIautovivifying\fR hashes in Python i\&.e\&. with autovivifying hashes, you can assign nested hash values without having to go to the trouble of creating intermediate levels if they don\(cqt exist e\&.g syscalls[comm][pid][id] = 1 will create the intermediate hash levels and finally assign the value 1 to the hash entry for \fIid\fR (because the value being assigned isn\(cqt a hash object itself, the initial value is assigned in the TypeError exception\&. Well, there may be a better way to do this in Python but that\(cqs what works for now)\&.
.sp
Putting that code into the raw_syscalls__sys_enter() handler, we effectively end up with a single\-level dictionary keyed on syscall id and having the counts we\(cqve tallied as values\&.
.sp
The print_syscall_totals() function iterates over the entries in the dictionary and displays a line for each entry containing the syscall name (the dictionary keys contain the syscall ids, which are passed to the Util function syscall_name(), which translates the raw syscall numbers to the corresponding syscall name strings)\&. The output is displayed after all the events in the trace have been processed, by calling the print_syscall_totals() function from the trace_end() handler called at the end of script processing\&.
.sp
The final script producing the output shown above is shown in its entirety below (syscall_name() helper is not yet available, you can only deal with id\(cqs for now):

The script can be run just as before:

.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
So those are the essential steps in writing and running a script\&. The process can be generalized to any tracepoint or set of tracepoints you\(cqre interested in \- basically find the tracepoint(s) you\(cqre interested in by looking at the list of available events shown by \fIperf list\fR and/or look in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/ for detailed event and field info, record the corresponding trace data using \fIperf record\fR, passing it the list of interesting events, generate a skeleton script using \fIperf script \-g python\fR and modify the code to aggregate and display it for your particular needs\&.
.sp
After you\(cqve done that you may end up with a general\-purpose script that you want to keep around and have available for future use\&. By writing a couple of very simple shell scripts and putting them in the right place, you can have your script listed alongside the other scripts listed by the \fIperf script \-l\fR command e\&.g\&.:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
# perf script \-l
List of available trace scripts:
  wakeup\-latency                       system\-wide min/max/avg wakeup latency
  rw\-by\-file <comm>                    r/w activity for a program, by file
  rw\-by\-pid                            system\-wide r/w activity
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A nice side effect of doing this is that you also then capture the probably lengthy \fIperf record\fR command needed to record the events for the script\&.
.sp
To have the script appear as a \fIbuilt\-in\fR script, you write two simple scripts, one for recording and one for \fIreporting\fR\&.
.sp
The \fIrecord\fR script is a shell script with the same base name as your script, but with \-record appended\&. The shell script should be put into the perf/scripts/python/bin directory in the kernel source tree\&. In that script, you write the \fIperf record\fR command\-line needed for your script:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
# cat kernel\-source/tools/perf/scripts/python/bin/syscall\-counts\-record

#!/bin/bash
perf record \-a \-e raw_syscalls:sys_enter
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \fIreport\fR script is also a shell script with the same base name as your script, but with \-report appended\&. It should also be located in the perf/scripts/python/bin directory\&. In that script, you write the \fIperf script \-s\fR command\-line needed for running your script:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
# cat kernel\-source/tools/perf/scripts/python/bin/syscall\-counts\-report

#!/bin/bash
# description: system\-wide syscall counts
perf script \-s ~/libexec/perf\-core/scripts/python/syscall\-counts\&.py
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the location of the Python script given in the shell script is in the libexec/perf\-core/scripts/python directory \- this is where the script will be copied by \fImake install\fR when you install perf\&. For the installation to install your script there, your script needs to be located in the perf/scripts/python directory in the kernel source tree:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
# ls \-al kernel\-source/tools/perf/scripts/python

.sp
Once you\(cqve done that (don\(cqt forget to do a new \fImake install\fR, otherwise your script won\(cqt show up at run\-time), \fIperf script \-l\fR should show a new entry for your script:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

\&.ft C
# perf script \-l

and display the output using \fIperf script report\fR:

.SH "STARTER SCRIPTS"
.sp
You can quickly get started writing a script for a particular set of trace data by generating a skeleton script using \fIperf script \-g python\fR in the same directory as an existing perf\&.data trace file\&. That will generate a starter script containing a handler for each of the event types in the trace file; it simply prints every available field for each event in the trace file\&.
.sp
You can also look at the existing scripts in ~/libexec/perf\-core/scripts/python for typical examples showing how to do basic things like aggregate event data, print results, etc\&. Also, the check\-perf\-script\&.py script, while not interesting for its results, attempts to exercise all of the main scripting features\&.
.SH "EVENT HANDLERS"
.sp
When perf script is invoked using a trace script, a user\-defined \fIhandler function\fR is called for each event in the trace\&. If there\(cqs no handler function defined for a given event type, the event is ignored (or passed to a \fItrace_unhandled\fR function, see below) and the next event is processed\&.
.sp
Most of the event\(cqs field values are passed as arguments to the handler function; some of the less common ones aren\(cqt \- those are available as calls back into the perf executable (see below)\&.
.sp
As an example, the following perf record command can be used to record all sched_wakeup events in the system:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# perf record \-a \-e sched:sched_wakeup
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Traces meant to be processed using a script should be recorded with the above option: \-a to enable system\-wide collection\&.
.sp
The format file for the sched_wakep event defines the following fields (see /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_wakeup/format):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
 format:
        field:unsigned short common_type;
        field:unsigned char common_flags;
        field:unsigned char common_preempt_count;
        field:int common_pid;

        field:char comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];
        field:pid_t pid;
        field:int prio;
        field:int success;
        field:int target_cpu;
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The handler function for this event would be defined as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
def sched__sched_wakeup(event_name, context, common_cpu, common_secs,
       common_nsecs, common_pid, common_comm,
       comm, pid, prio, success, target_cpu):
       pass
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The handler function takes the form subsystem__event_name\&.
.sp
The common_* arguments in the handler\(cqs argument list are the set of arguments passed to all event handlers; some of the fields correspond to the common_* fields in the format file, but some are synthesized, and some of the common_* fields aren\(cqt common enough to to be passed to every event as arguments but are available as library functions\&.
.sp
Here\(cqs a brief description of each of the invariant event args:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
event_name                 the name of the event as text
context                    an opaque \*(Aqcookie\*(Aq used in calls back into perf
common_cpu                 the cpu the event occurred on
common_secs                the secs portion of the event timestamp
common_nsecs               the nsecs portion of the event timestamp
common_pid                 the pid of the current task
common_comm                the name of the current process
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
All of the remaining fields in the event\(cqs format file have counterparts as handler function arguments of the same name, as can be seen in the example above\&.
.sp
The above provides the basics needed to directly access every field of every event in a trace, which covers 90% of what you need to know to write a useful trace script\&. The sections below cover the rest\&.
.SH "SCRIPT LAYOUT"
.sp
Every perf script Python script should start by setting up a Python module search path and \*(Aqimport\(cqing a few support modules (see module descriptions below):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
 import os
 import sys

 sys\&.path\&.append(os\&.environ[\*(AqPERF_EXEC_PATH\*(Aq] + \e
              \*(Aq/scripts/python/Perf\-Trace\-Util/lib/Perf/Trace\*(Aq)

 from perf_trace_context import *
 from Core import *
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The rest of the script can contain handler functions and support functions in any order\&.
.sp
Aside from the event handler functions discussed above, every script can implement a set of optional functions:
.sp
\fBtrace_begin\fR, if defined, is called before any event is processed and gives scripts a chance to do setup tasks:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
def trace_begin():
    pass
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fBtrace_end\fR, if defined, is called after all events have been processed and gives scripts a chance to do end\-of\-script tasks, such as display results:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
def trace_end():
    pass
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fBtrace_unhandled\fR, if defined, is called after for any event that doesn\(cqt have a handler explicitly defined for it\&. The standard set of common arguments are passed into it:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
def trace_unhandled(event_name, context, event_fields_dict):
    pass
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The remaining sections provide descriptions of each of the available built\-in perf script Python modules and their associated functions\&.
.SH "AVAILABLE MODULES AND FUNCTIONS"
.sp
The following sections describe the functions and variables available via the various perf script Python modules\&. To use the functions and variables from the given module, add the corresponding \fIfrom XXXX import\fR line to your perf script script\&.
.SS "Core\&.py Module"
.sp
These functions provide some essential functions to user scripts\&.
.sp
The \fBflag_str\fR and \fBsymbol_str\fR functions provide human\-readable strings for flag and symbolic fields\&. These correspond to the strings and values parsed from the \fIprint fmt\fR fields of the event format files:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
flag_str(event_name, field_name, field_value) \- returns the string representation corresponding to field_value for the flag field field_name of event event_name
symbol_str(event_name, field_name, field_value) \- returns the string representation corresponding to field_value for the symbolic field field_name of event event_name
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The \fBautodict\fR function returns a special kind of Python dictionary that implements Perl\(cqs \fIautovivifying\fR hashes in Python i\&.e\&. with autovivifying hashes, you can assign nested hash values without having to go to the trouble of creating intermediate levels if they don\(cqt exist\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
autodict() \- returns an autovivifying dictionary instance
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "perf_trace_context Module"
.sp
Some of the \fIcommon\fR fields in the event format file aren\(cqt all that common, but need to be made accessible to user scripts nonetheless\&.
.sp
perf_trace_context defines a set of functions that can be used to access this data in the context of the current event\&. Each of these functions expects a context variable, which is the same as the context variable passed into every event handler as the second argument\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
common_pc(context) \- returns common_preempt count for the current event
common_flags(context) \- returns common_flags for the current event
common_lock_depth(context) \- returns common_lock_depth for the current event
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Util\&.py Module"
.sp
Various utility functions for use with perf script:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nsecs(secs, nsecs) \- returns total nsecs given secs/nsecs pair
nsecs_secs(nsecs) \- returns whole secs portion given nsecs
nsecs_nsecs(nsecs) \- returns nsecs remainder given nsecs
nsecs_str(nsecs) \- returns printable string in the form secs\&.nsecs
avg(total, n) \- returns average given a sum and a total number of values
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
