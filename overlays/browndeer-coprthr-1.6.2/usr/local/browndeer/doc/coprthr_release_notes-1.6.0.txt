Comments on the "Freewill" release of the COPRTHR SDK
=====================================================

The COPRTHR SDK version 1.6 (Freewill) is released just over 4 years
after the original design of the key components such as the STDCL^®^ API
for compute offload accelerators (once synonymous with GPUs). During
this time various APIs for heterogeneous computing including "industry
standards" have been promoted by vendors. Nevertheless, the community
has failed to reach a consensus around a single approach to the
fundamental task of developing portable code for heterogeneous platforms
with accelerators. The relatively recent hardware entry of Intel Xeon
Phi has compounded the confusion and lack of a clear path toward
portable performant code.

The COPRTHR SDK continues to provide unique capabilities for programming
accelerators. STDCL provides an intuitive API that is superior in many
ways to the few alternatives that exist today. Code written years ago in
STDCL remains as portable and stable today as code written using other
"industry standards". If anything, applications written using STDCL have
"aged" better than many popular alternatives.

The COPRTHR clcc compiler tools support a standard compilation model for
pre-compiled executables and libraries reflecting the normal workflow
for most application developers. The combination of clcc with STDCL
provides a powerful and efficient development tool for writing concise
portable code for accelerators within a a traditional workflow.

The COPRTHR SDK also provides innovative software technology like CLRPC
for networked devices and CLETE for expression template based automatic
acceleration. With the Freewill release we add a new low-level API based
on the logical extension of pthreads for co-processors in an effort to
address new requriements for co-processor architectures with fully
divergent cores and other capabilities not found with traditional GPUs.

We continue to push forward with the COPRTHR SDK because we believe it
provides a valuble tool for code development targeting accelerators and
co-processors.

Support and Requirements {#support_and_requirements}
========================

Full SDK support is provided for Linux, Ubuntu, and FreeBSD operating
systems. Additionally, the STDCL API is supported for Windows 7.

Supported hardware includes AMD and Nvidia GPUs, Intel and AMD x86
multicore CPUs, Intel MIC accelerators, ARM multicore CPUs, and Epiphany
multicore processors. The COPRTHR SDK leverages vendor OpenCL
implementations for portability and also provides OpenCL implementions
for multicore processors to provide truly cross-vendor/cross-device
support for heterogeneous computing platforms.

Installation
============

Installation Overview
---------------------

The COPRTHR SDK may be installed from pre-compiled binaries for selected
platforms or built from source. It may be necessary to install one or
more 3rd-party packages as part of the installation process as described
above in the previous section [Support and
Requirements)(\#support\_and\_requirements).

For Linux and FreeBSD installation a configure script is provided to
customize the package. Detailed descriptions of the various options are
described at the end of this section.

Source and binary releases of the COPRTHR SDK are available from the
[download
page](http://www.browndeertechnology.com/coprthr_download.html).

Alternatively, the latest updates and development branch may be found on
the [github project page](http://www.github.com/browndeer/coprthr).

Linux and FreeBSD Installation

The following generic steps can be used to install the COPRTHR SDK on

Suggested System-Specific Configurations
----------------------------------------

The following are just a few examples of common system-specific
configurations to be used as a guide for installing COPRTHR SDK on your
specific platform. In very many cases, simply using ./configure will
work if you have installed 3rd-party software in standard locations.

Linux using only AMD APP SDK for CPU/GPU
:   
        ./configure --with-opencl-platform=amdapp

Linux using AMD APP SDK for CPU/GPU and COPRTHR OpenCL for CPU also
:   
        ./configure --enable-libcoprthr --with-opencl-platform=amdapp,coprthr

Linux using only Nvidia OCL for GPU
:   
        ./configure --enable-libcoprthr --with-opencl-platform=nvidia 

Linux using only Intel OCL for CPU/GPU
:   
        ./configure --with-opencl-platform=intel

Linux or FreeBSD standalone installation with COPRTHR OCL for CPU (x86)
:   
        ./configure --enable-libcoprthr

Linux standalone installation with COPRTHR OCL for CPU (ARM)
:   
        ./configure --enable-libcoprthr 

Parallella/Epiphany support
:   
        ./configure --enable-epiphany

Important Notes
===============

-   This release has been updated to use the Epiphany SDK version 5 and
    supports production Parallella platforms.

-   On Windows 7 platforms the function init\_stdcl() must be called to
    initialize the STDCL API. This call is unnecessary for Linux and
    FreeBSD, but there is no harm in including it since it will default
    to an empty macro.

-   The version of the boost library (1.47.0) used here for development
    unfortunately has a very minor bug that prevents it from working
    with MSVS 2010. A fix to the boost package is provided in this
    release. Just follow the instructions under the
    `msvs2010/boost_1_47_0-multi_array-iterator-fix/` directory. (All
    you need to do is copy over a replacement for iterator.hpp.)

-   Some example kernels include the stdcl.h header. Including this
    header for OpenCL kernels allows the use of alternate syntax that
    avoids breaking C. Programmers are encouraged to begin this practice
    now. A future release will formalize syntax corrections to OpenCL to
    produce a C compliant language for programming thread functions
    (kernels). The alternate syntax will be completely backward
    compatable with OpenCL.
